Damer: A Simple and Fast Reasoner for DatalogMTL Rule Language
===========
Damer is a python library, serving a reasoner for DatalogMTL Rule Language, a kind of knowledge representation language that extends Datalog
with operators from metric temporal logic (MTL). It provides many easy-to-use and independent interfaces, which are quite useful in coping with
DatalogMTl-related issues. To our best knowledge, it is the first ope-source library for reasoning temporal ontology-based data with DatlogMTL.
Implemented methods cover a wide range of theoretic works published in some top conferences, like `IJCAI <https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/0261.pdf>`_,
`KR <https://proceedings.kr.org/2020/79/kr2020-0079-walega-et-al.pdf>`_.

We are continuously working on providing more detailed descriptions about this library...
